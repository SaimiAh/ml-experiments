# 🧠 ML Experiments

> A 90-day Machine Learning journey — built automatically, one experiment at a time.

## 🤖 How it works

A bot runs every night at **11 PM Germany time** via GitHub Actions.

| Situation | What happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| I pushed code that day | Bot does nothing |
| I didn't push anything | Bot writes the next ML experiment and commits it |

No duplicates ever. Never runs out. Completely automatic.

## 📚 Curriculum — 90 topics across 3 phases

| Phase | Days | Topics covered |
|-------|------|----------------|
| 🟢 Foundations | 1 – 30 | Linear regression, gradient descent, KNN, SVM, decision trees, neural networks |
| 🔵 Intermediate | 31 – 60 | XGBoost, transformers, BERT, GANs, reinforcement learning, NLP |
| 🟣 Advanced | 61 – 90 | RAG, LLM fine-tuning, diffusion models, vector databases, production ML |

After day 90 → loops back with advanced variations and never stops.
